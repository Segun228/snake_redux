# React-Redux Snake Game

This project is a classic Snake game implemented using React for the user interface and Redux for state management.  It's designed to be a fun and engaging demonstration of these technologies working together.
This is my first Redux pet project btw.

## Features

•   Classic Snake gameplay: Eat apples, grow longer, avoid walls and self-collision.
•   Score tracking:  Displays the current score and high score.
•   Increasing difficulty:  The snake moves faster as the score increases.
•   Responsive design:  Playable on various screen sizes.
•   Redux state management:  Centralized state for game logic and UI updates.
•   Simple and clean UI:  Easy to understand and navigate.
•   Pause functionality: Pause/resume the game pressing space.
